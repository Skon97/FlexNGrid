         so it makes perfect sense that you need to be creative to succeed.<br> And you don't have to be an artist or a writer to apply your creative thinking; <br>
         there are many challenges that need creative solutions.<br>
          For example, a particular system in the game may need some heavy computing, <br>so you can come up with a creative solution that instead of fully computing the problem, <br>
         you merely use a simpler formula and estimate the result. </p></l></div>

    <div><h1 class="p2"> is a PC better than a console?</h1><p class="p2">When considering the epic battle between console or PC,
       it's important to consider not only budget,<br> 
       but what experience overall you are looking to have.<br>
        As a gamer, are you most concerned with convenience? <br>
        Or cost? Multi-player online gaming?<br>
         Do you enjoy or would you be interested in upgrading a computer yourself? <br>
         At CrucialÂ® the answer is clear; PC gaming is king. <br>
         It's a better experience gaming on a PC than console due to all the advantages that PC gaming offers. <br>
         No matter what you choose, the important thing is to play and have fun.</p></div>
         <div><h1 class="p2"> FPS vs. TPS</h1><p class="p2">I was having a conversation with someone about games when they asked "What's the advantage of playing a shooter in third-person?" My first response was cover systems. It's pretty rare for a fps to have an actual mechanic for taking cover beyond crouching/prone. But is that it?

          The next thing that came to mind was bodily awareness,
           but this isn't a problem I have or hear about when playing an fps.
            The only other thing that came to mind was perhaps a better feeling of immersion from playing in first-person but that's subjective.
             What are your thoughts on this? 
             Am I missing any larger difference between the mechanics of the two genres beyond PoV?</p></div>
